      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>I have worked from nature for many years, I enjoy the discovery of a funny shaped leaf, or a fallen log covered with bright orange and purple mushrooms blooming after a rainy period. These found objects become a starting point for my studio investigation. My artwork has always been based on a traditional observation process, however the final appearance of the objects in the paintings is informed by contemporary ideas and concerns and more recently by my own quirky interpretation of the objectsâ€™ personality. Where these found objects lead me in my artwork has to do with my interests in surrealism and abstraction along with the pure physical pleasure of using color and paint.</p>
